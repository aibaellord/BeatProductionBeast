# Developer Onboarding Guide

Welcome to BeatProductionBeast development! This guide will help you get started as a contributor or integrator.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/BeatProductionBeast.git
   cd BeatProductionBeast
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your secrets.
3. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   make dev
   # or
   uvicorn src.api:app --reload
   ```

## Contribution Workflow
- Follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
- Use pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting.
- Write tests for all new features (see `src/tests/`).
- Document your code and update docs as needed.

## Useful Commands
- `make test` – Run all tests with coverage
- `make lint` – Lint the codebase
- `make format` – Auto-format code
- `make docker-build` – Build Docker image
- `make docker-run` – Run in Docker

## Business Integrations
- Integrate with payment providers (Stripe, PayPal) for investment and subscription features.
- Use analytics endpoints for business intelligence and growth tracking.
- Expand revenue streams by connecting new platforms in `revenue_integration.py`.

For advanced integration, see the API reference and architecture docs.

## Advanced Automation APIs
- See [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md) for endpoints:
  - /remix-challenge/
  - /batch-release/
  - /auto-curation/
  - /influencer-collab/
  - /auto-translation/
  - /sync-marketplace/upload/
  - /sync-marketplace/match/
