# BeatProductionBeast

BeatProductionBeast is an advanced AI-powered tool for music production, beat generation, and audio processing using neural networks, quantum algorithms, and sacred geometry principles. It features a fully automated, one-click pipeline for remixing, generating, and distributing consciousness-enhancing audio content.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/BeatProductionBeast.git
   cd BeatProductionBeast
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your secrets.
3. Run the CLI or main automation pipeline:
   ```bash
   python -m src.cli
   # or
   python src/main.py
   ```

## 🌟 Features
- Neural, quantum, and sacred geometry audio processing
- One-click automation pipeline (see AUTOMATION_PIPELINE.md)
- Multi-layered remix and variation generation
- Adaptive workflows and advanced optimization
- Batch processing and multi-platform distribution
- Modular, extensible architecture

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Option 1: Install Using pip

```bash
# Install from PyPI (if available)
pip install BeatProductionBeast

# Or install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/username/BeatProductionBeast.git
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation with Virtual Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/BeatProductionBeast.git
   cd BeatProductionBeast
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   On Windows:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install the package in development mode**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Dependencies

The main dependencies include:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array operations
- **PyTorch**: For neural network implementations and deep learning capabilities

Dependencies are automatically installed when using pip, but you can install them manually with:
```bash
pip install numpy torch
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Beat Generation

```python
from beatproductionbeast import NeuralBeatArchitect

# Initialize the beat generator
generator = NeuralBeatArchitect()

# Generate a basic beat with default settings
beat = generator.create_beat(tempo=120, style="hip-hop")

# Export the beat as an audio file
beat.export("my_generated_beat.wav")
```

### Audio Processing

```python
from beatproductionbeast import AudioProcessor

# Load an existing audio file
processor = AudioProcessor("existing_track.wav")

# Apply neural enhancement
processor.enhance_audio(intensity=0.7)

# Apply style transfer from another track
processor.transfer_style("reference_track.wav", strength=0.5)

# Save the processed audio
processor.save("enhanced_track.wav")
```

### Style Analysis and Fusion

```python
from beatproductionbeast import StyleAnalyzer, FusionGenerator

# Analyze the style of multiple tracks
analyzer = StyleAnalyzer()
style1 = analyzer.analyze("track1.wav")
style2 = analyzer.analyze("track2.wav")

# Create a fusion of the two styles
fusion = FusionGenerator()
new_beat = fusion.create_fusion([style1, style2], blend_ratio=[0.6, 0.4])
new_beat.export("fusion_beat.wav")
```
